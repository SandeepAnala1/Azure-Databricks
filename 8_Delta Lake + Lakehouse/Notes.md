# Delta Tables: Overview and Importance

## **What is a Delta Table?**
A Delta table is a type of data storage format that extends Parquet data files with a transaction log, enabling ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions and scalable metadata handling. This format is used in Databricks to manage large-scale data analytics efficiently.

## **Why Delta Tables are Needed:**
1. **ACID Transactions:** Delta tables ensure data integrity by supporting ACID transactions, making them suitable for concurrent data modifications and reliable data pipelines.
2. **Scalable Metadata Handling:** Delta tables efficiently handle metadata for large datasets, improving performance in terms of query speed and manageability.
3. **Unified Batch and Stream Processing:** Delta tables allow seamless integration of batch and stream processing, enabling real-time data analytics.
4. **Time Travel:** Delta tables support time travel, allowing users to query historical data and recover from accidental data loss or corruption.
5. **Schema Enforcement and Evolution:** Delta tables ensure data quality by enforcing schemas and support schema evolution to adapt to changing data structures.

## Delta Format for a Table

The Delta format is essentially a combination of Parquet files with a transaction log that tracks changes to the data.

# **Components of a Delta Table:**
1. **Parquet Files:** Store the actual data in a columnar format, providing efficient storage and retrieval.
2. **Transaction Log:** A series of JSON files that record every change (e.g., addition, modification, deletion) made to the data. This log enables ACID transactions and time travel capabilities.

## **Creating and Using Delta Tables:**

**Creating a Delta Table:**
```python
# Create a Delta table from an existing Parquet file
df = spark.read.format("parquet").load("path/to/parquet/file")
df.write.format("delta").save("path/to/delta/table")

# Create a Delta table directly
data = [(1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Charlie")]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["id", "name"])
df.write.format("delta").save("/mnt/delta/people")
```

**Reading from a Delta Table:**
```python
# Read the Delta table
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/delta/people")
df.show()
```

**Performing Operations on Delta Tables:**
- **Upsert (Merge):** Combine insert, update, and delete operations.
  ```python
  from delta.tables import *

  deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/people")
  deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
      source=df.alias("source"),
      condition="target.id = source.id"
  ).whenMatchedUpdate(set={"name": "source.name"}) \
   .whenNotMatchedInsert(values={"id": "source.id", "name": "source.name"}) \
   .execute()
  ```
- **Delete:**
  ```python
  deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/people")
  deltaTable.delete("id = 2")
  ```
- **Update:**
  ```python
  deltaTable.update(
      condition="id = 3",
      set={"name": "'Charles'"}
  )
  ```

3. **Querying Historical Data:** Users can query historical data by specifying a version number or a timestamp, allowing them to access the state of the data as it existed at that point.

**Example of Time Travel with Delta Lake:**
```python
# Enable Delta Lake
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")

# Write data to a Delta table
data = [(1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Charlie")]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["id", "name"])
df.write.format("delta").save("/mnt/delta/people")

# Make some changes to the Delta table
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/people")
deltaTable.update(condition="id = 3", set={"name": "'Charles'"})
deltaTable.delete("id = 2")

# Query the Delta table as of a specific version
df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 1).load("/mnt/delta/people")
df.show()

# Query the Delta table as of a specific timestamp
df = spark.read.format("delta").option("timestampAsOf", "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z").load("/mnt/delta/people")
df.show()
```

By combining the advantages of data lakes and data warehouses, the data lakehouse architecture provides a versatile and scalable platform for modern data analytics, addressing many of the limitations associated with traditional data lakes while enabling advanced analytics capabilities like time travel.

# Incremental Loading: Overview and Example

## What is Incremental Loading?

Incremental loading is a data integration technique used to efficiently update a data store with only the new or modified data since the last update. This approach is crucial for handling large datasets where loading the entire data every time is impractical and resource-intensive.

**Key Concepts of Incremental Loading:**
1. **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Identifying and capturing changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in the source data.
2. **Delta Load:** Loading only the data changes (deltas) instead of the entire dataset.
3. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** The process of extracting changes from the source, transforming them as needed, and loading them into the target system.

## Incremental Loading with an Invoices Example

Let's consider a scenario where you have an `invoices` table in a transactional database, and you want to incrementally load this data into a data warehouse or data lake.

**Source Table: `invoices`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    invoice_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    invoice_date DATE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Target Table: `invoices` (in Data Warehouse/Data Lake)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    invoice_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    invoice_date DATE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Steps for Incremental Loading:**

1. **Identify Changes:**
   - Use the `last_updated` timestamp to identify records that have been inserted or updated since the last load.

2. **Extract Changes:**
   - Extract new or updated records from the source table based on the `last_updated` timestamp.

3. **Transform Data:**
   - Apply any necessary transformations to the extracted data.

4. **Load Data:**
   - Upsert (update/insert) the extracted records into the target table.

### Example Implementation

Assuming the last load timestamp is stored in a variable called `last_load_timestamp`, the following steps illustrate the incremental loading process using SQL and PySpark.

**Step 1: Identify Changes in Source (SQL)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices
WHERE last_updated > '2023-07-01 00:00:00'; -- Replace with last_load_timestamp
```

**Step 2: Extract and Transform Data (PySpark)**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("IncrementalLoading").getOrCreate()

# Define the source and target paths or tables
source_table = "source_invoices"
target_path = "/mnt/delta/invoices"

# Load the last load timestamp (from a metadata table or a config file)
last_load_timestamp = "2023-07-01 00:00:00"  # Example timestamp

# Extract changes from the source table
incremental_data = spark.sql(f"""
    SELECT * FROM {source_table}
    WHERE last_updated > '{last_load_timestamp}'
""")

# Perform any necessary transformations (if needed)
transformed_data = incremental_data  # Assuming no transformations needed

# Load the target Delta table
delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, target_path)

# Upsert the incremental data into the target Delta table
(delta_table.alias("target")
 .merge(transformed_data.alias("source"), "target.invoice_id = source.invoice_id")
 .whenMatchedUpdateAll()
 .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()
 .execute())
```

**Step 3: Load Data into Target (SQL or PySpark)**
- The above PySpark code snippet already handles the upsert operation using Delta Lake.

### Advantages of Incremental Loading

1. **Efficiency:** Reduces the amount of data processed, leading to faster load times and reduced resource usage.
2. **Scalability:** Handles large datasets more efficiently by processing only changes.
3. **Timeliness:** Enables more frequent data updates, providing near real-time data for analysis.
4. **Cost Savings:** Lowers storage and compute costs by minimizing data movement and processing.

### Summary

Incremental loading is an essential technique for maintaining up-to-date data in data warehouses or data lakes, especially when dealing with large datasets. By efficiently capturing and loading only the changes, it ensures data consistency and reduces the overhead associated with full data loads. The provided example demonstrates how to implement incremental loading for an `invoices` table using SQL and PySpark with Delta Lake.
