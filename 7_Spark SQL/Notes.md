# Interview question on Partition

  This explains how to determine the number of partitions for a file in Spark based on its size. Here's a detailed breakdown:
  
  1. **General Formula**:
     - Number of Partitions = Total Size / MaxSplitBytes
     - MaxSplitBytes is set to 8 (possibly 8 MB, though the unit is not specified here).
  
  2. **Specific Conditions**:
     - **Condition 1**: If the file size is greater than 128 MB:
       - The file is always split into partitions of 128 MB each.
     - **Condition 2**: If the file size is less than 128 MB and greater than OpenCostBytes (4 MB):
       - The number of partitions is equal to the number of cores available.
     - **Condition 3**: If the file size is less than 128 MB and less than OpenCostBytes (4 MB):
       - The number of partitions is set to 1.
  
  ### Explanation of `OpenCostBytes` in Spark
  
  `OpenCostBytes` is a parameter in Spark that determines the threshold for the file size in relation to the cost of opening files. In the context of the screenshot, OpenCostBytes is set to 4 MB. This means:
  - If a file is smaller than 4 MB, it is more efficient to process it as a single partition (hence, the number of partitions is 1).
  - If a file is larger than 4 MB but smaller than 128 MB, the number of partitions will be determined based on the number of cores, indicating a balance between parallel processing and the cost of managing multiple file splits.

### Summary

- Files larger than 128 MB are split into 128 MB partitions.
- Files between 4 MB and 128 MB are split based on the number of cores.
- Files smaller than 4 MB are processed as a single partition.

# Temporary View

In layman terms, a **view** in SQL (including Spark SQL) is like a virtual table. It's a way to look at and interact with data as if it were a table, even though the data might actually come from one or more different tables. You can think of it as a saved query that you can run whenever you need it, without having to write the query again.

A **temporary view** is a type of view that exists only within the current session. Once the session ends, the temporary view is deleted. It's useful for creating and using views without the need for them to persist permanently.

Let's use the provided DataFrame to create a temporary view in Spark SQL.

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame
data = [("Alice", "Math", 95),
        ("Alice", "Science", 88),
        ("Bob", "Math", 92),
        ("Bob", "Science", 90),
        ("Carol", "Math", 85),
        ("Carol", "Science", 78)]

columns = ["Name", "Subject", "Score"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Create a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("student_scores")

# Now you can run SQL queries on the "student_scores" view
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM student_scores").show()
```

In this code:
1. We create a DataFrame `df` with sample data.
2. We create a temporary view called "student_scores" from the DataFrame.
3. We can then run SQL queries on the "student_scores" view as if it were a table. The last line demonstrates how to select all data from the temporary view.


Temporary views are important in the data engineering space for several reasons:

1. **Ease of Querying and Reusability**: Temporary views allow you to write complex queries once and then reuse them multiple times within your session. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

2. **Data Exploration**: When you're exploring data, temporary views provide a quick way to transform and analyze data without making changes to the underlying data or creating permanent tables.

3. **Performance**: By breaking down complex transformations into smaller steps and creating temporary views, you can improve the performance of your data processing tasks. This is because each temporary view can be optimized and executed more efficiently by the Spark engine.

4. **Collaboration**: Temporary views enable multiple users to work with the same data in a consistent manner within a shared session. This is useful for collaborative data analysis and debugging.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Temporary views are useful for testing and debugging complex queries. You can create intermediate views to check the results at various stages of your data processing pipeline.

6. **Flexibility**: Temporary views provide flexibility in managing the scope of your data transformations. Since they are session-specific, they do not persist beyond the session, which makes them ideal for temporary data processing tasks and ad-hoc analysis.

7. **Memory Management**: Temporary views help in managing memory usage. Since they do not persist, they are automatically cleaned up when the session ends, ensuring that memory is not unnecessarily occupied by temporary data.

### Example of Using Temporary Views in Data Engineering

Suppose you are working on a data pipeline where you need to perform several transformations on a large dataset. You can use temporary views to break down the transformations into manageable steps:

1. **Loading Data**:
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("large_dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   df.createOrReplaceTempView("raw_data")
   ```

2. **Filtering Data**:
   ```python
   filtered_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM raw_data WHERE status = 'active'")
   filtered_df.createOrReplaceTempView("filtered_data")
   ```

3. **Aggregating Data**:
   ```python
   aggregated_df = spark.sql("""
       SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(price) as avg_price
       FROM filtered_data
       GROUP BY category
   """)
   aggregated_df.createOrReplaceTempView("aggregated_data")
   ```

4. **Final Transformation**:
   ```python
   final_df = spark.sql("""
       SELECT category, count, avg_price
       FROM aggregated_data
       WHERE count > 100
   """)
   final_df.show()
   ```

In this example:
- We start by loading the data into a DataFrame and creating a temporary view `raw_data`.
- We then create another temporary view `filtered_data` after filtering the raw data.
- We perform an aggregation and create another temporary view `aggregated_data`.
- Finally, we perform a transformation on the aggregated data and display the results.

By using temporary views, we can easily manage each step of the transformation process, making the code more readable, modular, and easier to debug.
