# Interview question on Partition
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff2927c4-e628-4ff1-9f25-89c79cd39260)

  This explains how to determine the number of partitions for a file in Spark based on its size. Here's a detailed breakdown:
  
  1. **General Formula**:
     - Number of Partitions = Total Size / MaxSplitBytes
     - MaxSplitBytes is set to 8 (possibly 8 MB, though the unit is not specified here).
  
  2. **Specific Conditions**:
     - **Condition 1**: If the file size is greater than 128 MB:
       - The file is always split into partitions of 128 MB each.
     - **Condition 2**: If the file size is less than 128 MB and greater than OpenCostBytes (4 MB):
       - The number of partitions is equal to the number of cores available.
     - **Condition 3**: If the file size is less than 128 MB and less than OpenCostBytes (4 MB):
       - The number of partitions is set to 1.
  
  ### Explanation of `OpenCostBytes` in Spark
  
  `OpenCostBytes` is a parameter in Spark that determines the threshold for the file size in relation to the cost of opening files. In the context of the screenshot, OpenCostBytes is set to 4 MB. This means:
  - If a file is smaller than 4 MB, it is more efficient to process it as a single partition (hence, the number of partitions is 1).
  - If a file is larger than 4 MB but smaller than 128 MB, the number of partitions will be determined based on the number of cores, indicating a balance between parallel processing and the cost of managing multiple file splits.

### Summary

- Files larger than 128 MB are split into 128 MB partitions.
- Files between 4 MB and 128 MB are split based on the number of cores.
- Files smaller than 4 MB are processed as a single partition.

# Temporary View

In layman terms, a **view** in SQL (including Spark SQL) is like a virtual table. It's a way to look at and interact with data as if it were a table, even though the data might actually come from one or more different tables. You can think of it as a saved query that you can run whenever you need it, without having to write the query again.

A **temporary view** is a type of view that exists only within the current session. Once the session ends, the temporary view is deleted. It's useful for creating and using views without the need for them to persist permanently.

Let's use the provided DataFrame to create a temporary view in Spark SQL.

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame
data = [("Alice", "Math", 95),
        ("Alice", "Science", 88),
        ("Bob", "Math", 92),
        ("Bob", "Science", 90),
        ("Carol", "Math", 85),
        ("Carol", "Science", 78)]

columns = ["Name", "Subject", "Score"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Create a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("student_scores")

# Now you can run SQL queries on the "student_scores" view
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM student_scores").show()
```

In this code:
1. We create a DataFrame `df` with sample data.
2. We create a temporary view called "student_scores" from the DataFrame.
3. We can then run SQL queries on the "student_scores" view as if it were a table. The last line demonstrates how to select all data from the temporary view.


Temporary views are important in the data engineering space for several reasons:

1. **Ease of Querying and Reusability**: Temporary views allow you to write complex queries once and then reuse them multiple times within your session. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

2. **Data Exploration**: When you're exploring data, temporary views provide a quick way to transform and analyze data without making changes to the underlying data or creating permanent tables.

3. **Performance**: By breaking down complex transformations into smaller steps and creating temporary views, you can improve the performance of your data processing tasks. This is because each temporary view can be optimized and executed more efficiently by the Spark engine.

4. **Collaboration**: Temporary views enable multiple users to work with the same data in a consistent manner within a shared session. This is useful for collaborative data analysis and debugging.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Temporary views are useful for testing and debugging complex queries. You can create intermediate views to check the results at various stages of your data processing pipeline.

6. **Flexibility**: Temporary views provide flexibility in managing the scope of your data transformations. Since they are session-specific, they do not persist beyond the session, which makes them ideal for temporary data processing tasks and ad-hoc analysis.

7. **Memory Management**: Temporary views help in managing memory usage. Since they do not persist, they are automatically cleaned up when the session ends, ensuring that memory is not unnecessarily occupied by temporary data.

### Example of Using Temporary Views in Data Engineering

Suppose you are working on a data pipeline where you need to perform several transformations on a large dataset. You can use temporary views to break down the transformations into manageable steps:

1. **Loading Data**:
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("large_dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   df.createOrReplaceTempView("raw_data")
   ```

2. **Filtering Data**:
   ```python
   filtered_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM raw_data WHERE status = 'active'")
   filtered_df.createOrReplaceTempView("filtered_data")
   ```

3. **Aggregating Data**:
   ```python
   aggregated_df = spark.sql("""
       SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(price) as avg_price
       FROM filtered_data
       GROUP BY category
   """)
   aggregated_df.createOrReplaceTempView("aggregated_data")
   ```

4. **Final Transformation**:
   ```python
   final_df = spark.sql("""
       SELECT category, count, avg_price
       FROM aggregated_data
       WHERE count > 100
   """)
   final_df.show()
   ```

In this example:
- We start by loading the data into a DataFrame and creating a temporary view `raw_data`.
- We then create another temporary view `filtered_data` after filtering the raw data.
- We perform an aggregation and create another temporary view `aggregated_data`.
- Finally, we perform a transformation on the aggregated data and display the results.

By using temporary views, we can easily manage each step of the transformation process, making the code more readable, modular, and easier to debug.

# Hive Metastore

The Hive metastore in Databricks is a central repository that stores metadata for relational entities such as databases, tables, columns, and partitions. It's an essential component of the Apache Hive architecture and is used by Databricks to manage and query structured data stored in various formats. Here's a detailed explanation of the Hive metastore and its role in Databricks:

### Key Functions of Hive Metastore in Databricks

1. **Metadata Management**:
   - The Hive metastore holds metadata about tables, including their schema (column names, data types), table properties, and information about data location.
   - It supports both managed and external tables. Managed tables are controlled entirely by Databricks, while external tables point to data stored outside of Databricks' control.

2. **Schema Evolution**:
   - The Hive metastore allows for schema evolution, meaning you can alter the schema of tables over time without disrupting existing data or workflows.
   - This feature is particularly useful in dynamic environments where data structures can change.

3. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Partitioning is a technique to divide a large table into smaller, manageable pieces. The metastore maintains partition information, enabling efficient querying and data retrieval.
   - Partitions can be based on one or more columns, and the metastore tracks these partitions for optimized access.

4. **Interoperability**:
   - The Hive metastore in Databricks can interoperate with other data processing tools and frameworks that support Hive, such as Apache Spark, Apache Impala, and Presto.
   - This interoperability allows for a unified metadata layer across different tools, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.

5. **Data Governance**:
   - It provides a central point for managing access controls and auditing for data assets.
   - With the integration of tools like Apache Ranger or Databricks' own access management features, the metastore aids in enforcing security policies and compliance requirements.

### How Hive Metastore Works in Databricks

1. **Integration with Spark SQL**:
   - Databricks uses the Hive metastore to manage the metadata for Spark SQL queries. When you create a database or table in Databricks, the metadata is stored in the Hive metastore.
   - This integration ensures that Spark can optimize query plans using the metadata, leading to efficient execution.

2. **Catalog and Database Management**:
   - Databricks provides a catalog interface to interact with the Hive metastore, allowing users to create, drop, and alter databases and tables.
   - Commands like `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, and `ALTER TABLE` manipulate the metadata stored in the metastore.

3. **Table Management**:
   - When you create a table in Databricks, you can specify whether it is a managed or external table. The metastore will track this information, along with the location of the data.
   - Managed tables have their data stored in Databricksâ€™ default storage location, while external tables store data at an external location (e.g., an S3 bucket).

4. **Query Optimization**:
   - The metadata in the Hive metastore helps Spark SQL optimize query execution. It provides information about data distribution, storage format, and partitioning, allowing Spark to generate efficient query plans.

### Example Usage in Databricks

Here's an example of how to interact with the Hive metastore in Databricks:

1. **Creating a Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE my_database;
   ```

2. **Creating a Managed Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE my_database.my_table (
       id INT,
       name STRING,
       age INT
   );
   ```

3. **Creating an External Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE my_database.external_table (
       id INT,
       name STRING,
       age INT
   )
   USING CSV
   LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/my-data/';
   ```

4. **Querying Tables**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM my_database.my_table;
   ```

5. **Partitioning a Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE my_database.partitioned_table (
       id INT,
       name STRING,
       age INT
   )
   PARTITIONED BY (age);
   ```

In these examples:
- We create a new database called `my_database`.
- We create a managed table `my_table` and an external table `external_table` with data stored in an S3 bucket.
- We query the `my_table` to retrieve all records.
- We create a partitioned table `partitioned_table` to manage large datasets efficiently.

### Conclusion

The Hive metastore in Databricks plays a crucial role in managing metadata, enabling schema evolution, optimizing queries, and ensuring interoperability with other data processing tools. Its integration with Spark SQL and the Databricks environment provides a powerful and flexible platform for data engineering tasks.


# With & without Unity Catalog

the key concepts and differences between using Hive Metastore and Unity Catalog in Databricks:

### Without Unity Catalog
1. **Hive Metastore (Catalog)**:
   - The Hive Metastore acts as the central catalog for managing metadata in Databricks.
   - It stores information about databases, schemas, tables, and views.

2. **Database (Schema)**:
   - A logical grouping of tables and views within the Hive Metastore.
   - Helps organize and manage data in a structured manner.

3. **Tables/Views**:
   - **Tables**: Store actual data in a structured format (rows and columns).
   - **Views**: Virtual tables created by querying one or more tables.

### With Unity Catalog
1. **Metastore**:
   - The central repository for managing all data assets across multiple Databricks workspaces.
   - Provides unified data governance and access control.

2. **Hive Metastore (Catalog)**:
   - Continues to function as a catalog but is now integrated within the broader Unity Catalog.
   - Manages metadata for databases, schemas, tables, and views.

3. **Database (Schema)**:
   - Functions similarly to the previous setup, organizing tables and views within the metastore.

4. **Tables/Views**:
   - **Tables**: Same as before, storing structured data.
   - **Views**: Virtual tables created from querying data in one or more tables.

### Managed Table
- **Managed Table**:
  - Both data and metadata are managed by Databricks.
  - Databricks handles the storage, maintenance, and optimization of these tables.

### External Table
- **External Table**:
  - Data is managed by the customer (user).
  - Metadata (information about the table structure, location, etc.) is managed by Databricks.
  - Allows users to keep data in their preferred storage systems while still leveraging Databricks for metadata management and query optimization.

### Summary
- **Without Unity Catalog**: The Hive Metastore acts as the sole catalog for managing database schemas and tables/views.
- **With Unity Catalog**: A more comprehensive data governance framework that includes the Hive Metastore, allowing for better data management, security, and access control across multiple Databricks environments.
- **Managed Table**: Databricks handles both data and metadata.
- **External Table**: Users manage the data, and Databricks manages the metadata.
